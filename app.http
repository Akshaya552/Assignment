    "content" : "Once upon a time, there was a wise old man who lived in a small village. He was known throughout the land for his wisdom and his ability to solve any problem that came his way.One day, a young man came to the wise old man and said, “I have a problem. I have been wronged by someone and I want revenge. What should I do?”.The wise old man replied, “Before you seek revenge, you should ask yourself if it is worth it. Revenge may make you feel better in the short term but it will not bring you true happiness.”The young man thought about this for a moment and then asked, “But what if I don’t seek revenge? Won’t people think that I am weak?”. The wise old man replied, “True strength comes from within. It takes more courage to forgive than it does to seek revenge. If you can find it in your heart to forgive those who have wronged you, you will find true happiness.”The young man thought about this for a moment and then thanked the wise old man for his advice. He left the village feeling much better than he had before.",
